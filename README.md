# https://farisnafiah.netlify.app/

The first iteration of my personal website. This pet project is aimed to familiarise myself with React and CSS. This website is created using create-react-app and hosted with Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/101715ae-1620-4218-8b8d-3463330522a0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/farisnafiah/deploys)

Since this project is not aimed for UI/UX design, the design is inspired by [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com/), although I changed quite a few elements. Everything is built from scratch without the dependency of Brittanyâ€™s codes (which uses Gatsby and Webpack instead).

Demo can be found here: [farisnafiah.netlify.app](https://farisnafiah.netlify.app/)
